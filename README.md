# DATA-CLEANING

This repository contains code and resources for cleaning the FIFA21 dataset. The dataset contains information about football players, including their attributes, performance statistics, and contract details.

# Methods Used: 

1. Data Type Conversion: The dataset may have columns with incorrect data types. We carefully convert the data types of columns to ensure consistency and accuracy. For example, converting string representations of numbers to numeric data types.

2. Standardizing and Cleaning Text: Text columns often contain inconsistencies, such as leading or trailing whitespace, different capitalization, or special characters. We apply text cleaning techniques to standardize and clean these columns for better analysis and visualization.

3. Feature Engineering: We create new features from the existing data that can provide additional insights or improve the analysis. This may involve calculating derived metrics, aggregating data, or creating categorical variables based on certain conditions.

4. Data Validation: We validate the dataset for integrity and correctness, ensuring that the data follows the expected patterns and rules. This includes checking for data inconsistencies, logical errors, or unrealistic values.
