# Methods Used: 
1. Data Type Conversion: The dataset may have columns with incorrect data types. We carefully convert the data types of columns to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. Standardizing and Cleaning Text: Text columns often contain inconsistencies, such as leading or trailing whitespace, different capitalization, or special characters. I apply text cleaning techniques to standardize and clean these columns

3. Feature Engineering: I create new features from the existing data that can provide additional insights or improve the analysis. This  creating categorical variables based on certain conditions.

4. Data Validation: We validate the dataset for integrity and correctness, ensuring that the data follows the expected patterns and rules.
